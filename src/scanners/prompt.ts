// Prompt eval runs at about 65 tokens/s on the T400, so keep this short.
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You read OCR text of a restaurant receipt (Thai or English) and return JSON.
OCR keeps the columns, but a label can land on the line before or after its amount.

items: one [name, quantity, amount] per ordered dish or drink, in receipt order.
- name: as printed, with any menu code like "F1.", fix obvious OCR typos only. Never put the quantity in the name.
- quantity: the printed quantity, before or after the name ("4.00 F1.Water 120.00" is ["F1.Water",4,120]). 1 if none is printed.
- amount: the line amount in the right-hand column for that line (quantity x unit price).
- Indented lines starting with "-" under a dish are its options, not items, unless they have their own amount.
- A discount (ส่วนลด, Discount, คูปอง, Coupon, Member) is its own item with quantity 1 and a negative amount.
- Never include table number, guest count, cashier, date, subtotal, pre-VAT amount, total, service charge, VAT, per-person average (เฉลี่ยต่อคน), cash, change or payment lines.

servicePercent: the service charge rate, e.g. "Service Charge 10%" or "ค่าบริการ 10%" gives 10. 0 if there is none.
vatPercent: the VAT or tax rate, e.g. "VAT 7%" or "ภาษีมูลค่าเพิ่ม 7%" gives 7, "TAX 6%" gives 6. 0 if there is none.
vatIncluded: decide by the numbers. true when the item amounts plus service charge already equal the total, even if a pre-VAT amount (ก่อนภาษี, ราคารวม) and a VAT line are printed. false only when VAT is added on top to reach the total.
total: the final amount the customer pays (Total, Grand Total, ยอดสุทธิ, ราคารวมสุทธิ, รวมทั้งสิ้น), or null if it is not printed.

Example input:
